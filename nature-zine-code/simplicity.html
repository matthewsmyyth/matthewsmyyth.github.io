		<h2>Lessons From Nature</h2>
		<h3> by Linda 
			<br> December 2007
		</h3>
		<p>
			
			 I watch the waves crash in, breaking on the shore <br>
All their anger dispensed on the oceans floor<br>
I look at the sky so blue, sun shining so bright<br>
Spreading heat and happiness with its blinding light
<br>
<br>Long blades of grass swaying in the gentle breeze <br>
Dancing in rhythm with so much ease<br>
Look up at the trees hearing the singing of the birds<br>
Happily chirping singing at ease without words
<br>
<br>Sitting here holding my knees to my chest<br>
Watching and hearing nature at its best<br>
I ponder how Nature could get it so right<br>
When we have let Nature's lessons get so out of sight
<br>
<br>We hold our anger, let our happiness slip away<br>
Making our survival a struggle each and every day<br>
We have forgotten the little things that mean so much<br>
Like the laughter, the freedom, and someone's loving touch
<br>
<br>If only I could make people stop, watch and listen to Natures tale <br>
We could all sit back happily and our world would not be so frail<br>
In each others existence in harmony we could all survive<br>
I'm sure like the sun, wind, tree, and birds our lives we could revive
<br>
<br>If only we let nature take its course in each and every day and night <br>
As I sit and ponder how Nature got it so right and we lost all sight.

	<h2>I Love A Lonely Winding Road</h2>
	<h3>by Alora M. Knight
		<br>November 2014
	</h3>
		<p>
			I love a lonely winding road<br>
That takes me where I cannot see<br>
Until each softly rounded hill<br>
Reveals its landscaped mystery.<br>
Where nature's stage creates the plot, <br>
What ever the scene may be.
		
<br>
<br> I love the crocus call in spring,<br>
The first to wake from winter's sleep.<br>
Translucent bits of ivory joy,<br>
So patient under snow banks deep,<br>
'Til they can lift each star like face<br>
And proudly nature's rhythm keep.
<br>
<br>I love the fiery autumn hues,<br>
Too harsh to bear in gentle spring<br>
But welcomed by the strident wind<br>
That makes the mighty pine tree sing,<br>
Freeing the crimson leaves that dance<br>
Like bright birds, high on wing.
<br>
<br>I love the wonders of this world,<br>
The secrets nature guards so well<br>
From those who have no time to spend,<br>
Who will not lift the ocean's shell<br>
And listen to the murmured tale<br>
That each one has to tell.

	<h2>The Soul Print</h2>
	<h3>by Scott Mcintire
		<br>July 2015
	</h3>
		<p>
			Sitting in peaceful places<br>
Upon Nature's natural faces<br>
Silent sounds of the River's rushing<br>
The Wind with the Trees harmoniously brushing
		<br>
		<br> Quiet Clouds above calmly passing by <br>
A Sea of blue and white that pleases the Eye<br>
Mountains in the distance sit still in yellow light<br>
The Sun ahead constantly coloring every sight
		<br>
		<br>Never again will we ever be here<br>
At this very moment let us not fear<br>
For this is where the mind is content<br>
This is where the Soul leaves its print
