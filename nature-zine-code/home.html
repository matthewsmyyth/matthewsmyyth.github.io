		<h3> Nature inspires us
		</h3>
		<p>we seek to articulate how nature affects us as human beings. Nature has a way of capturing our hearts. Rooted in creation, we are meant to gaze and marvel at the wonders of our world. Based on this belief we have chosen to describe nature with five words. Within each page you will discover poetry and photography and how it exemplifies the word. Please feel free to dive deeper and discover yourself amidst the serenity in the raw.
