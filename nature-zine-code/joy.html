		<h2>A Place Like This</h2>
		<h3> by Milo Shumpert

			<br> July 2007
		</h3>
		<p>
			
			 It is an early morning<br>
I need an island in the sea,<br>
Away from you away from me,<br>
Beyond the waves beyond the wind,<br>
Beyond the world that we live in,<br>
<br>
Under skies of shining stars,<br>
Away from lights and noisy cars,<br>
Above the egos and the stress,<br>
Beyond the world we made a mess.<br>
<br>
A place for me a place for you,<br>
An earth that's green a sky that's blue,<br>
A place for you a place for me,<br>
An open sky and light blue sea,<br>
<br>
With dreams as solid as the ground,<br>
A place like this I think I've found.<br>
A happy thought no one can take it,<br>
A place like this is where we make it.<br>
<br>
I need a mountain in the sky,<br>
Just beneath where angels fly,<br>
Where snowflakes falling on the ground,<br>
Is the most disruptive sound,<br>
<br>
Above the waves above the wind,<br>
Above the world that we live in,<br>
Above my life above the stress,<br>
Where I can lay it all to rest,<br>

	<h2>Wake Up!</h2>
	<h3>by Prinkie
		<br>December 2008
	</h3>
		<p>
			 It's true that the darkness flies and blue times fade away,<br>
Though to cast obscure and gloomy vista is its forte,<br>
But there is always a dawn of radiant light at its archway.<br>
Wake up! Open your eyes, rise to another new day.<br>
<br>
The sun sneaks in to proclaim over the landscape askew.<br>
Oh, look how the rays tear apart the skies to reach you<br>
And then split to the seven true colors as they pass a tiny dew.<br>
Wake up! Open your eyes, rise to another new day.<br>
<br>
Extend your ears to how the feathered friends' melodiously hum.<br>
And thus relieving themselves from the night so irksome.<br>
Thus for a pristine novel life they together extend a welcome.<br>
Wake up! Open your eyes, rise to another new day.<br>

	<h2>I Long For The Wild</h2>
	<h3>by Casey Hatfield
		<br>December 2015
		
	</h3>
		<p>
			 I long for the wild<br>
To feel the wind upon my skin like a thousand soft kisses, <br>
it's fingers through my hair like a passionate lover.<br>
<br>
I long for the wild<br>
The sweet smell of pine, dirt under my feet,<br>
Quakies, quivering, as their branches dance on the breeze.<br>
<br>
I long for the wild<br>
The roar of a river,<br>
the sound of water making love to the shore line.<br>
<br>
I long for the wild<br>
To lay upon velvety grass, bathing in the soft glow of moonlight,<br>
gazing up at the stars, to feel small.<br>
<br>
I long for the wild<br>
It calls to me like a mother calls her child to come home.
