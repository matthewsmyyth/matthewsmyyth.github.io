		<h2>Nature's Hand</h2>
		<h3> by Carol Lafreniere

			<br> February 2011
		</h3>
		<p>
			
			 Walking towards a wishful dream,<br>
By your side a crooked stream,<br>
Above, the clouds are fluffy cream,<br>
No longer do you want to scream.<br>
<br>
The air, it smells so sweet.<br>
The birds go, twitter tweet.<br>
Soft grass to place your feet.<br>
You groove with nature's beat.<br>
<br>
Out here, there are no cars.<br>
Out here, there are no bars.<br>
Nighttime brings you Venus, Mars,<br>
Uncountable amounts of stars.<br>
<br>
Take it all in friendly stride,<br>
Don't ever feel you have to hide.<br>
This is where you reach inside,<br>
And spread your wings; feel them glide.<br>
<br>
Your life is yours, not theirs to take.<br>
Light a fire by the lake.<br>
Always love, with whom you wake,<br>
Never let your friendships break.<br>
<br>
Always live without regret.<br>
Don't give up, not now, not yet.<br>
Know the future isn't set.<br>
Appreciate what love you get.<br>
<br>
I know that nature's trees are tall,<br>
There's some you cannot climb at all<br>
Full in Spring 'til Autumn's Fall,<br>
Covered in a winter shawl.<br>
<br>
And as the seasons come and go,<br>
You'll see the stream begin to grow.<br>
Filled by your whole life you know,<br>
Carried in the winds that blow.<br>
<br>
Listen to the song it sings-<br>
Love and peace is what it brings.<br>
Sharing all the little things,<br>
Smoothing over dents and dings.<br>
<br>
That what living's all about.<br>
Never fill it up with doubt.<br>
Look real close to find this out-<br>
Always seek the kinder route.<br>
<br>
And you will see, my oldest friend,<br>
This dreamy life, it has no end.<br>
There's always more beyond the bend,<br>
Nature's hand, a limb, to lend.<br>

	<h2>The Forest's Blessed Abode</h2>
	<h3>by Belinda Stotler
		<br>December 2017
	</h3>
		<p>
			 Come walk with me into the forest's blessed abode,<br>
To see the wondrous beauty the Earth has bestowed;<br>
We'll bask in the surreal splendor that surrounds us,<br>
And listen to nature composing the forest's grand opus,<br>
As sounds of whispering trees and burbling streams,<br>
Send our minds wandering into a poet's lovely dreams.<br>
<br>
We'll walk where sunlight sets the forest's leaves aglow,<br>
Weaving open paths to dapple golden light on all below;<br>
Where trees shade us from summer heat and harsh rays,<br>
Freeing our minds so we can see Mother Nature's ways,<br>
Of creating nurturing sanctuaries for life dwelling there,<br>
To shield its tender wards from storms too hard to bear.<br>
<br>
Come sit beneath the glowing embers of an autumn tree,<br>
Whose rich hues are a natural wonder many come to see,<br>
While colorful leaves glide down in a whirling course,<br>
Like embers breaking loose from their flaming source,<br>
Glowing for a moment as if falling to their ending fate,<br>
Instead, nourishing Earth for rebirth into a new state.<br>

</p>

<p>
<br>
The wintering forest seems to be a still desolate place,<br>
Yet, under the snow and autumn leaves of a tree's base,<br>
Beats the promising pulse of new life that patiently waits,<br>
For spring's warmth and rain to open wide nature's gates;<br>
Roam with me under the trees standing strong over it all,<br>
To watch them quietly sleep until nature's beckoning call.<br>
<br>
Let us stroll in spring's forest where we will reap,<br>
The joy of Earth awakening its children from sleep,<br>
And hear life's chorus and watch its offspring grow,<br>
As waking trees renew their canopy over all below;<br>
Come share with me the forest's spirit at rebirth,<br>
So we too are reborn within this temple of Earth.<br>
<br>
Every now and then let us answer the forest's call,<br>
To come see life's beauty and the miracle of it all;<br>
If we listen with our hearts as we walk among trees,<br>
We may understand the message carried on a breeze,<br>
For us to blend with the forest's spirit so it will beguile,<br>
Us into walking under its lovely trees for just a while.<br>
