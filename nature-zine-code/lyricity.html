		<h2>Gold Parade</h2>
		<h3> by Tow'rs

			 If you see it <br>
Ask it for me <br>
Why it eludes me so<br>
<br>
Sleep comes easy <br>
It's rest I still need <br>
To slow my troubled mind <br>
<br>
From the window there's a frame, <br>
a tree a gold parade <br>
Losing her leaves to winter's name, <br>
see for me that I, see for me 
that I change <br>
my restless ways <br>
<br>
Time is winning <br>
Always winning <br>
We paint with permanence <br>
<br>
If yoke is easy <br>
Then bear my body <br>
And bridle my thoughts <br>
<br>
From the window there's a frame, <br>
a tree a gold parade <br>
Losing her leaves to winter's name, <br>
see for me that I, see for me 
that I, Change <br>
<br>

	<h2>Tall Pine</h2>
	<h3>by David Hoffmann
		<br>June 2008
	</h3>
		<p>
			Upon her crystal shores... waves of shimmering light. <br>
Part of a larger symphony near water's edge.<br>
Under tall pine a leaf gently spirals to the ground.<br>
A small note... unheard by most. A piece of that song.<br>

A myriad of light from so far away... but really not so far.<br>
A glimmer highlights the base of tall pine.<br>
Blending with the fallen leaf's song.<br>
A neighbor's melody of change.<br>
<br>
A different forest. A new time.<br>
Within the sounds... a symphony.<br>
Within the rhythm... a remembrance.<br>
A note heard by those who choose to listen.<br>
<br>
Touched by a myriad of lights.<br>
Reflecting upon a small leaf.<br>
Sounds blending under tall pine.<br>
Dancing around a tree... upon crystal shores.<br>

	<h2>Nature's Way</h2>
	<h3>by Heidi Campbell
		<br>July 2007
		
	</h3>
		<p>
			Upon a nice mid-spring day,<br>
Let's take a look at Nature's way.<br>
Breathe the scent of nice fresh air,<br>
Feel the breeze within your hair.<br>
<br>
The grass will poke between your toes,<br>
Smell the flowers with your nose.<br>
Clouds form shapes within the skies,<br>
And light will glisten from your eyes.<br>
<br>
Hear the buzzing of the bees,<br>
Climb the tallest willow trees.<br>
Look across the meadow way,<br>
And you shall see a young deer play.<br>
<br>
Pick the daisies as they grow,<br>
Watch a gentle cold stream flow.<br>
Know the sounds of water splash,<br>
Catch its glimmer in a flash.<br>
<br>
When altogether all seems sound,<br>
Lay yourself upon the ground.<br>
Take a moment to inhale,<br>
And listen to Nature tell her tale...<br>
