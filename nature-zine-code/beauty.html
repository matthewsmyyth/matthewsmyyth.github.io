		<h2>Spring</h2>
		<h3> by Camille Gotera

			<br> December 2013
		</h3>
		<p>
			
			 When the cold, harsh winter has given its last breath,
			 <br>
When the sky above shows life instead of death,
			<br>
When the claws reaching to the frozen sky become decorated with leaves,<br>
When the animals -long in hiding- scurry from trees,<br>
We know winter has ended.
<br>
<br>
When the frost on grass is replaced with sweet dew,<br>
When the fields become dotted with flowers,
reminding me of you,
When the lonely silence becomes filled with 
melodies, <br>
When you feel warm air, erasing bad memories
We know winter has ended.<br>
<br>
<br>
When the hard, bare ground becomes painted with green, <br>
When the frost-bitten air becomes fresh and clean,<br>
When the coats and boots are all stored away,<br>
When the playgrounds become occupied again with child's play,<br>
We know winter has ended.
<br>
<br>
When you hear the pleasant sound of children's laughter,<br>
When the air is filled with joy- long sought after,<br>
When the world is filled with sunlight, brighter and longer,<br>
When the song of Mother Nature becomes 
stronger,<br>
Spring has begun.

	<h2>Where Peaceful Waters Flow</h2>
	<h3>by Keith Burroughs
		<br>February 2011
	</h3>
		<p>
			The clouds break forth the streams of light <br>
To dance upon the earth,<br>
And cradled in the sands of time, <br>
Comes a newborn baby's birth.<br>
A gentle breeze blows through the night, <br>
It whispers through the grass,<br>
And ripples on the water form <br>
As rain glistens on the glass.<br>
<br>
<br>
And you listen to the sound, <br>
The Lord's presence all around.<br>
He summons us to go <br>
Where peaceful waters flow.<br>
<br>
<br>
A rainbow arcs across the sky, <br>
A promise is displayed.<br>
The graceful flight of a butterfly, <br>
It takes my breath away.<br>
The autumn leaves in their splendor <br>
Fall gracefully to the earth,<br>
And stars proclaim their song at night,<br> 
What is their beauty worth?<br>
<br>
<br>
And you listen to the sound, <br>
The Lord's presence all around.<br>
He summons us to go <br>
Where peaceful waters flow.<br>

	<h2>Peace</h2>
	<h3>by Bessie Rayner Parkes
		
	</h3>
		<p>
			The steadfast coursing of the stars, <br> 
The waves that ripple to the shore, <br>
The vigorous trees which year by year <br> 
Spread upwards more and more; 
<br>
<br>

The jewel forming in the mine, <br>
The snow that falls so soft and light, <br> 
The rising and the setting sun, <br>
The growing glooms of night; <br>
<br>

All natural things both live and move <br>
In natural peace that is their own; <br>
Only in our disordered life <br>
Almost is she unknown. <br>
<br>
She is not rest, nor sleep, nor death; <br>
Order and motion ever stand <br>
To carry out her firm behests <br>
As guards at her right hand. <br>
<br>
And something of her living force <br>
Fashions the lips when Christians say <br>
To Him Whose strength sustains the world, <br>
"Give us Thy Peace, we pray!"<br>
